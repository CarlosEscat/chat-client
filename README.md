## BUNQ Assigment - Chat App

### Built with React - Redux

In the three hours that I built the App, I managed to create a small chat, where the user selects what name from a given list, he wants to use. Once he has choosen one, that opens the conversation with the rest of the users and a message board.

On the message board user is greated with his name and can see a list of messages identified with the id of the user who sent it, the user can write a message and send it to the conversation, which will show on the message board.

## Things I would add

Having a little bit more of time I would have liked to add some features, such us:

### Being able to choose and add a conversation room

### Select the user or users you want to add to a conversation room

### User can delete a message

### More visually appealing design
